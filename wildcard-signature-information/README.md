#Wildcard Signature Information

List of wildcard signatures contained in PRONOM v86.

The list only includes wildcards in the 'standard' signature set, and
does not include container signatures. 

This is a reasoned, but ultimately arbitrary delineation. 

The rationale, because container signatures are expected to lead to
a more precise identification by having to go via a container type (OLE2, ZIP)
and then into a file/folder, before matching against an (optional) bytestream:
