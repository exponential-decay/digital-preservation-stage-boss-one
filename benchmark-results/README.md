#Benchmark Results   

Part of the digital-preservation-stage-boss repository. 

CSV files are organised into the three tests completed:

*govdocs-analysis.csv: A record of all the runs over Govdocs Select
*fake_govdocs-analysis.csv: A record of all the runs over a Govdocs Simulant
*wavs-analysis.csv: A record of all the runs over public wav collection: http://resources.openpreservation.org/dp-stage-boss-one/wavs/ 

Also included for convenience, the excel report I've been working from to generate charts. The charts
themselves in PNG format.
